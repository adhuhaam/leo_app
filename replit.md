# Passport OCR Dashboard

An AI-powered passport data extraction tool for Bangladesh and Indian passports. Upload passport images or PDFs and the system automatically extracts name, passport number, dates, address, and nationality using GPT vision OCR.

## Run & Operate

- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev` — run the API server (port 8080)
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/passport-ocr run dev` — run the web frontend (port varies)
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/passport-ocr-mobile run dev` — run the Expo mobile app (Expo Go)
- `pnpm run typecheck` — full typecheck across all packages
- `pnpm run build` — typecheck + build all packages
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` — regenerate API hooks and Zod schemas from the OpenAPI spec
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` — push DB schema changes (dev only)
- Required env: `DATABASE_URL` — Postgres connection string
- Required env: `AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_BASE_URL` + `AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_API_KEY` — OpenAI via Replit AI Integrations

## Stack

- pnpm workspaces, Node.js 24, TypeScript 5.9
- Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- API: Express 5
- DB: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- Validation: Zod (`zod/v4`), `drizzle-zod`
- OCR: OpenAI GPT vision (via Replit AI Integrations, no API key needed)
- File uploads: multer (memory storage)
- PDF-to-image: pdf2pic + sharp
- API codegen: Orval (from OpenAPI spec)
- Build: esbuild (CJS bundle)

## Where things live

- `lib/api-spec/openapi.yaml` — API contract (source of truth)
- `lib/db/src/schema/passports.ts` — Passport table schema
- `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/passports.ts` — Passport CRUD + upload routes
- `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/ocr.ts` — OpenAI vision OCR extraction logic
- `artifacts/passport-ocr/src/` — React frontend (pages, components)
- `artifacts/passport-ocr-mobile/app/` — Expo mobile app (file-based routes; tabs: Dashboard, Master, Capture, Billing, More)
- `artifacts/passport-ocr-mobile/lib/auth.tsx` — shared-password auth provider (cookie session, native persistence)

## Architecture decisions

- OCR is processed asynchronously: upload returns a `processing` record immediately, then OCR runs in background and updates to `completed`/`failed`
- File uploads use multer memory storage (no disk writes); PDF pages converted to JPEG via pdf2pic before sending to GPT vision
- Images are resized to max 1600x1200 via sharp before OCR to reduce token usage
- `api-zod` tsconfig includes DOM lib to support File/Blob types generated from multipart spec

## Product

Users upload passport images (JPG, PNG, PDF) for Bangladesh and Indian passports. The app extracts: full name, passport number, date of birth, date of issue, date of expiry, address, and nationality. Extracted records are stored in PostgreSQL and displayed in a CRUD dashboard with search, filter, edit, and delete capabilities.

## Mobile app

The `passport-ocr-mobile` artifact is an Expo (React Native) client that reuses the same `/api` endpoints as the web dashboard. It signs in with the same shared password, persists the session cookie natively, and exposes:

- **Dashboard** — passport stats, quick actions, recent uploads
- **Master** — passport list with status/nationality filters and the latest-LOA company per candidate
- **Capture** — camera + document picker upload to `/api/passports/upload` (multipart; field `file`)
- **Billing** — invoices and quotations (view-only); detail view shows line items + GST totals
- **More** — Clients (view-only), Expenses (CRUD), and Sign-out

### Run locally
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/passport-ocr-mobile run dev` — starts Metro/Expo. Open in Expo Go on a device on the same network, or scan the QR.
- The app reads `EXPO_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` (set by the workflow) and points API calls at `https://${EXPO_PUBLIC_DOMAIN}` so it shares the proxied `/api` with the web app.

### Build an Android APK (EAS)
The repo already includes `artifacts/passport-ocr-mobile/eas.json` with a `preview` profile that emits an `.apk` (and a `production` profile for Play Store `.aab`).

1. Install the CLI once: `npm i -g eas-cli`
2. `cd artifacts/passport-ocr-mobile && eas login` (free Expo account).
3. First time only: `eas init` — links the project to your Expo account and writes the `projectId`.
4. Set the domain the APK should call (replaces the placeholder in `eas.json`):
   ```bash
   eas secret:create --scope project --name EXPO_PUBLIC_DOMAIN --value <your-replit-domain>
   ```
   …then either remove the `env.EXPO_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` line from `eas.json` (so the secret wins) or edit it to your domain directly.
5. `eas build -p android --profile preview` — EAS builds in the cloud and returns a downloadable `.apk` URL when finished (~10–15 min).
6. Side-load the APK on any Android device. Sign-in uses the same shared password as the web dashboard.

For the Play Store, swap `--profile preview` → `--profile production` to get an `.aab`.

## User preferences

_Populate as you build — explicit user instructions worth remembering across sessions._

## Gotchas

- Re-run `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` after any OpenAPI spec change
- `sharp` requires native build approval: run `pnpm approve-builds` and select sharp if PDF conversion fails
- Always run `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` after schema changes
- OCR uses `gpt-5.4` model with vision — requires `AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_BASE_URL` env var
